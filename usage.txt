pwmac - Generate a domain specific password from a master password.

Usage:
pwmac [-t timeout] [-s] [-c] [-l length] [-x] domain
pwmac -h

Description:
domain is any arbitrary string, that describes the domain the password is meant
for (e.g. domain.name or user@domain.name).

Options:
-t timeout
	Delete domain password from screen after timeout seconds. Default is 30.

-c
	Lets the user confirm the master password. This is recommended when
	generating a password with the purpose of setting it for the first time
	for that domain.

-l length
	Specifies the desired length of the generated domain password. Default
	is 8.

-x
	Silent mode. Copy domain password to X clipboard instead of displaying
	it

-s
	Read master password from stdin and print to stdout only the resulting
	domain password without prompt or trailing newline. This option enables
	using pwmac in pipes, which might come in handy for
	scripting.

-h
	Display this message and exit.
