.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pwmac
can be used to generate a password for any domain from a master password.
In contrast to a keystore, it does not save the domain specific passwords, but by remembering
the master password it is possible to generate the same domain password from the master password
and the domain descriptor.

.I domain
can be any string that describes the domain for which a password should be created. For different
domain descriptors
.B pwmac
generates different domain passwords no matter how similar they are and no matter if the master password is the same.
